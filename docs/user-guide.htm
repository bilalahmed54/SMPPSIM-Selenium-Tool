							INTRODUCTION
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						SMPPSim is a testing utility which mimics the behaviour of an SMPP based SMSC. SMPP stands for Short Message Peer to Peer Protocol. SMSCs (Short Message Service Centres) from Logica Aldiscon support this protocol, as a means of allowing external (to
						the GSM network) applications to submit and receive SMS messages to / from the SMSC. Some other SMSC vendors also support SMPP.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are intending to implement support for SMS text messaging using the SMPP protocol in your application, you will need some way of testing your application. Ultimately of course, you should aim to use a real SMSC for testing before going live.
						Hopefully the network operator you are working with can supply a test SMSC for this purpose. In some cases however, two factors make SMPPSim a useful tool for the initial stages of testing:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							It can take months to acquire a connection to a GSM network
						</li>
						<li>
							Some network operators run stringent acceptance tests before they will allow your application to interact with the production SMSCs. It can take weeks to complete these tests, even if things go well.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						So, it pays to have some independent means of doing your initial testing. Firstly so that your project is not completely dependent on acquiring a network connection in order to be able to progress, and secondly so that your code is as good as you can
						get it before entering the formal acceptance testing phase with the network operator.

							QUICK START
						</b>
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							For those in a hurry, here's what you need to do to get started using SMPPSim right away:
							<br>
							1. Write your SMPP (client) application!
							<br>
							2. Set up your java run-time environment. SMPPSim works with a
							<b>
								1.6.x Java
							</b>
							environment.
							<br>
							3. Expand the SMPPSim archive which you downloaded. If you downloaded the zip file for Windows, just use winzip in the normal way. If you downloaded the tar.gz file for unix, decompress it then extract the files in the archive by running:
							<br>
							<br>
							gunzip smppsim.tar.gz
							<br>
							tar xvf smppsim.tar
							<br>
							<br>
							4. Change to the SMPPSim home directory (SMPPSim) and run the script startsmppsim.bat (windows) or startsmppsim.sh (Unix)
						</p>

							USER INTERFACE
							<br>
							<br>
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						SMPPSim has a web based user interface which provides detailed information on PDUs sent and received and has a form which allows you to "inject" DELIVER_SM PDUs into SMPPSim's internal queues, for subsequent delivery to a suitable SMPP client
						application (ESME). See the section on
						<a href="#mo">
							Mobile Originated Messages
						</a>
						for further details. Access the User Interface by pointing your web browser at the server that SMPPSim is installed upon, specifying the port listed in the configuration file via the HTTP_PORT property. <br><br>
						So if SMPPSim is runing on your local computer
						and you have not changed the port from the default, the following address will bring up the SMPPSim user interface, assuming SMPPSim is running:
						<a href="http://localhost:88">

							MOBILE ORIGINATED MESSAGES
							<br>
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						SMPPSim provides three different ways in which to generate DELIVER_SM messages which are sent from SMPPSim to your application, thus simulating the delivery of mobile originated messages. These are as follows:
					</p>
					<p>
						1. The MO Injection Form
						<br>
						2. Loopback Service
						<br>
						3. MO Service
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
							The MO Injection form
						</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						SMPPSim includes a basic web server. By default it listens for connections on port 80. Point your browser at the host that SMPPSim is running on, and the port specified in your configuration file via the HTTP_PORT property, and the SMPPSim home page
						will appear. Click the &quot;Inject Mo Message&quot; link and the MO Injection Form will apear. Simply fill in the fields to suit your purposes and click Submit. A DELIVER_SM message will be inserted into SMPPSim's inbound queue and delivered to a
						suitable client that has bound as a receiver or transceiver and whose address_range matches the destination address of your message.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
							Loopback Service
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						The loopback service is enabled by setting the LOOPBACK property to TRUE in the props file. When activated in this way and provided there is an active Receiver object, all messages submitted to SMPPSim (SUBMIT_SM) via a Transmitter object will be
						converted into corresponding DELIVER_SM messages and added to the inbound queue from where it will be returned via an active Receiver object. In other word, every message your application sends gets delivered right back.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							MO Service
							<br>
						</b>
						<br>
						SMPPSim includes a feature known as the MO Service. By setting the DELIVERY_MESSAGES_PER_MINUTE property to a non-zero value, SMPPSim will periodically send a DELIVER_SM message to your application. The messages themselves are defined in a file
						whose name you specify in the configuration (by default it is deliver_messages.csv. Message records in this file are represented in comma separated format consisting of the source address, destination address and short message content. The message content can 
						either be a plain text message or a binary message. Messages are designated as binary by prefixing them with 0x and then formulating the message in hexadecimal notation, representing each byte value with a pair of hexadecimal digits. e.g. to include message "1234" in binary format, the
						short message field in the MO service input file should be specified as 0x31323334. For binary messages, data_coding will automatically be set to 4 by SMPPSim.<br><br>
						Once again, as with all three of the Mobile Originated Message features of SMPPSim, your application must bind as a receiver at least once for there to be a path available to SMPPSim for the delivery of such messages.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						<b>
							<a name="outbind"></a>
							OUTBIND
							<br>
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						SMPPSim can be configured to support the OUTBIND operation. If enabled (by setting OUTBIND_ENABLED=true) then this feature behaves as follows:
						<br>
						1. In the event that an MO message needs to be delivered, but there is no session available to receive the message then the message will be stored in the PENDING_QUEUE and an OUTBIND request sent to the IP address and port specified in the relevant OUTBIND_ properties.
						<br>
						2. OUTBIND will only be sent once in response to the PENDING_QUEUE becoming non-empty. Once the queue is empty again however, the internal flag that controls whether an OUTBIND should be sent or not is reset, and the next time the PENDING_QUEUE is non-empty, another OUTBIND will be sent.
					<hr>
					<p>
						<b>
							<a name="capture"></a>
							PDU CAPTURE
							<br>
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						SMPPSim can now be configured to capture, to separate files, any combination of:
						<br>
						a) PDUs received from the SME application by SMPPSim, in binary format
						<br>
						b) PDUs received from the SME application by SMPPSim, in decoded, character format
						<br>
						c) PDUs sent by SMPPSim to the SME application in binary format
						<br>
						d) PDUs sent by SMPPSim to the SME application in decoded, character format
						<br>
					<p>
						<br>
						This feature was provided to better support forms of testing such as regression testing. It is envisaged that capturing PDUs in binary format will be used to allow unexpected, PDU level changes, to be detected, possibly as part of an automated test
						suite. See configuration details above.
						<br>
						<br>
						Note that this feature is currently only supported when using hte (default) StandardProtocolHandler and StandardConnectionHandler classes.
						<b>
						</b>
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						<b>
							<a name="dr"></a>
							DELIVERY RECEIPTS
							<br>
							<br>
						</b>
						SMPPSim supports delivery receipts. To request a delivery receipt, just set the registered_delivery_flag in your SUBMIT_SM PDU, as per the SMPP specification. Note though that SMPPSim features a &quot;message life cycle simulator&quot; and this means
						that (as per the real world), not all messages get &quot;delivered&quot;. You can control how likely it is that your messages get delivered, using the probability settings in the smppsim.props configuration file, as described above. If your message
						does get delivered, and this may take some seconds or minutes after you originally submitted it, then SMPPSim will queue a delivery receipt for delivery to an appropriate session. An appropriate session is one which is bound as a transmitter or
						transceiver and which specified an address_range when binding, which matches the address the delivery receipt is addressed to.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						<b>
							<a name="testsuite"></a>
							TEST SUITE
							<br>
						</b>
						SMPPSim includes a JUnit test suite. The tests require 3 separate instances of SMPPSim, each with a different configuration to be running. A script which allows the required servers to be launched is supplied. Run either starttestservers.bat or
						starttestservers.sh to launch them. Then run the script runtests.bat or runtests.sh. Note that the latter scripts launch the JUnit GUI and are not suitable for use of a headless server. They may of course be amended to run JUnit in text mode. See the
						JUnit documentation for details of how to do this.
